Done:
Get list of players and store in a list (https://www.nba.com/stats)
Reformat df
Take in an initial guess, calculate the possible players based on a result
Return the list
Ask the user for next guess, repeat 
fix the name spacing on the original dataset

Extra:
***FIX SUBSEQUENT GUESS POSITION LOGIC***
check for arrows on either side
add age as a guess
check how g-f and c-f relate (yellow)
Fix bug team not removing on subsequent guesses
fix deepcopy west teams
rename variables
allow for stupid guesses (subsequent conference for example)
make height and number guessing smarter
add gitignore
fix error with apostrophe in name (Melton)
Seems not updated? Like Austin Reaves didn't show up after Curry on 6/30/23
Also players with same height can both show up
Need to make it so that the dataset updates regularly
